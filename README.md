# Shape Detection Using OpenCV

This project detects various geometric shapes (triangles, rectangles, pentagons, hexagons) in real-time video using OpenCV. The program captures video from the webcam, processes the frames to identify shapes based on color thresholds set via trackbars, and displays the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

First, make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
